Important items of note:

1. Accessibility for screen readers should be maintained at all times, follow proper modern html standards to keep the website screen reader friendly, ensure the very first tab will pop up a (normally hidden until selected) button for the usual "jump to content"

2. We use the "Dicier" font pack to help with generate screen reader friendly icons for things like dice and card suits and etc for game rules. Please refer to .github/agents/DicierUserGuide.txt for info on how to use this right.

3. Avoid using the "em dash" anywhere on the site.

4. Avoid use of emoji anywhere, it looks unprofessional

5. Always write content in a profesional and polished manner, focus on ease of readability and consistent terminology.

6. Keep the website mobile screen friendly, it should be designed to look very good on mobile.
