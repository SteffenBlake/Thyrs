# Thyrs {dicier:JOKER}

Thyrs is a TTRPG designed to be played with multiple sets of 52 card decks of playing cards. It can be played by any number of players, but its usually best enjoyed with around 2-4.

This game has no concept of a "Game Master", and instead the primary dictation of events derives from cards drown from a core "Dungeon Deck" of cards, which provides the source of random generation of the what the players encounter and contend with. Players take turns molding these random prompts from the deck into describing what everyone encounters and sees.

## About the game

### Premise

Thyrs is a storytelling game where each player takes on the role of a character that has been trapped deep within the chambers of some form of ancient megastructure, which will further be referred to as the "Dungeon". Players start by discussing what sort of dungeon they are trapped deep within, and what sort of story they want to play in. The dungeon could be an ancient labyrinth, a lich's keep, or perhaps a long abandonded space station. What is important are a few key factors:

1. They are trapped at the deepest part of this dungeon
2. They want to get out
3. Everyone starts gathered together in the first chamber
4. And everyone has a very good reason for how they ended up here

The reason for entrapment should be agreed upon next. Perhaps you are all banished prisoners, or maybe you were adventures who took a bad turn and through mishaps ended up falling down deeper than anticipated, or perhaps your life support systems gave out on your ship and you had to make an emergency landing. The options are endless! but what matters is you are here now, and you need to figure out how to survive and escape.

### The Thyrs
As per the namesake of the game:

#### Thyrs (þyrs)
Noun
monster, demon, giant

The Thyrs is the monstrous and supernatural threat that lurks in the dungeon. You see, you are not alone here, and you already can sense it. Something awful wanders through the chambers. Though you haven't encountered it yet, each character already can feel the chill down the back of their spines as they sense its presence. Players must agree on what the Dungeon's Thyrs is. It can be anything, as long as it fits the following criteria:

1. It is unimaginably dangerous and certain doom to engage with
2. You want to avoid it at all costs
3. This is its home/territory, and you are invaders in it.
4. It is without a doubt aggressive and will attack anyone in the same chamber as it

Its the minotaur of the labyrinth, the Typhon in Tartarus, the Kraken in the sea.

### What you need to play

To Play Thyrs, you will need the following:

1. A deck of 52 cards for each player (jokers removed)
2. One additional deck of 54 cards (with jokers intact) for the "Dungeon Deck".
3. (Recommended) Paper and pens/pencils for each player to keep track of their inventory and character's state
4. (Recommended) The "Narrator Marker", a token of some form to track the current Narrator
5. (Optional) A set of **Resource** tokens, approximately ~10 or so needed per player.
6. (Optional) A set of **Action Point* ("AP") tokens, approximately ~25 or so needed per player. Note you will want Resource and AP tokens to be visually distinct!
7. (Optional) 1 larger "**Stamina**" container ("pool") per player, enough to comfortably hold ~16 AP tokens in it at once
8. (Optional) 1 smaller "**Energy**" container ("pool") per player, enough to comfortably hold ~8 AP tokens in it at once (must be visually identifiable distinct from the Stamina container!)
9. (Optional) Additional containers for storing Resource tokens for players, and larger containers for storing excess tokens in the center of the table.


Recommendation: You will be well served to choose a deck with different visual appearance for each player and the Dungeon Deck, to make it easier to keep track of which cards belong to which/who's decks. Players are encouraged to bring their own decks to the table for personal flair.

### Setup

1. Each player removes the jokers from their respective decks, shuffles them, then places their deck in front of them at hand
2. The Dungeon Deck (with jokers intact) is shuffled, then placed at the center of the playing space
3. Players choose 12 **Augments** from the [Augment Table](#augment-table), ignoring the **Face** card **Augments** (those are **Curses**), and divide those **Aguemnts** as evenly as they can amongst the players' characters to possess.
   a. (Optional) for additional randomness, you may elect to instead draw cards from the top of the **Dungeon Deck** until you have drawn 12 non-**face** cards, and use those to select the **Augments** at random from the [Agument Table](#augment-table) via their associated card. See [Augments](#augments)
4. Each player draws up to their maximum **Stamina** storage limit worth of **Action Points** and places these in their **Stamina Pool**. See [Stamina](#stamina) for more information.
5. Each player draws up to their maximum **Energy** storage limit worth of **Action Points**, and places these in their **Energy Pool**. See [Energy](#energy) for more information.
6. Each player takes 2 **Resource** tokens. See [Inventory](#inventory) and [Resources](#resources) for more information.
7. Each player draws a random card from the **Dungeon Deck**, and uses that to look up a random piece of non-**enchanted** **equipment** on the [Equipment Table](#equipment-table) that their character starts the game with **Equipped**.
8. Select a player to have the first turn of being the **Narrator** by selecting them at random and giving them the **Narrator Marker**.
9. All drawn cards are now shuffled back into the **Dungeon Deck**.

## Game Rules

### Decks
**Decks** represent the source of randomness in the **Dungeon**. Whenever you discard a card for a given deck, you place it face up beside it in a **Discard Pile**. Whenever you would draw a card from an empty deck, shuffle the **Discard Pile** back into the **Deck** first, then draw the card.

### The Narrator
At any given time, one of the players is marked as the **Narrator** by being in possession of the **Narrator Token**. Whenever any random effect is rolled to signal something exists in the game (the **Chamber** itself, items or objects in the **Chamber**, events that occur in the **Chamber**), the **Narrator** gets to describe what it looks like. Most random effects will provide a few adjectives to describe the object vaguely, and it is up to the **Narrator** to fill in the gaps.

Note: This has no mechanical impact on the game, this is purely narrative for fun.

Everytime players take the **[Proceed](#proceed) Action**, the **Narrator Marker** is handed one player clockwise. The recipient is now the new **Narrator** for the next **Chamber**!

### Energy

**Energy** represents your character's form of *useable* **Action Points** you can use to perform **[Actions](#actions)**. Most **Actions** consume some amount of **Energy** as a cost.

**Energy** is stored in your **Energy Pool**, which by default has a maximum **Storage Limit** of 8, however various effects can alter this limit. Refilling your **Energy** requires [Stamina](#stamina) and [Resources](#resources). 

### Stamina
**Stamina** represents your character's form of *banked* **Action Points**, which you cannot actively use. You can, however, convert **Stamina** into **Energy** via spending [Resources](#resources) by taking the [Meal](#meal) action, and to refill your **Stamina Pool** you must take the [Sleep](#sleep) action. See the [Actions](#actions) section for more details.

### Capacity
**Capacity** represents how many items your character can carry with them at once. By default characters have a **Capacity** of 8. All [Items](#items) and [Resources](#resources) cost 1 **Capacity** each to be carried.

A character may exceed their **Capacity** by up to 5 by allowing themselves to become **Encumbered**. **Encumbered** characters must spend an additional 1 **Energy** to take the [Proceed](#proceed) **Action**. See the [Actions](#actions) section for more details.

Characters may discard any inventory [Items](#items) or [Resources](#resources) they wish. Discarding does not consume **Energy**, nor does it spend their turns **Action**. If an **Encumbered** character reaches zero **Energy**, they are forced to **Discard** enough **Items** immediately in order to no longer be **Encumbered**. **Discarded Items** remain in the [Chamber](#chambers) they were **Discarded** in, and can be retrieved later if the player wishes to.

### Resources

**Resources** represent materials required to sustain life amongst your group. Typically they in some form represent forms of water, food, and fuel. **Resources** consume 1 [Capacity](#capacity) each for the character carrying them.

Via the [Meal](#meal) **Action**, you can spend your **Resources** to convert [Stamina](#stamina) into [Energy](#energy)

### Items
**Items** take the form of one of two types: **Consumables** and **Equipment**. Either way they require one **Capacity** each to carry with you. **Note:** actively **Equipped** **equipment** do *not* count as being carried, and therefor do *not* consume **Capacity**.

### Consumables
You will find and acquire a wide variety of **Items** in the **Dungeon** that can be **Consumed** to perform all manner of effects. After spending a onsumable **item** it is removed from your inventory and your character is no longer carrying it.

### Equipment
**Equipment** comes in two forms. **Normal** and **Augmented**. Whenever you initially acquire a new **Equipment** (other than your character's starting one) you will have no idea if it is **Normal** or **Augmented**. To discover which it is, you must **Identify** it.

You can choose whether or not to carry or **Equip** a piece of **Equipment**. While carrying it, it consumes one **Capacity** and is not **Equipped**. You can choose to **Equip** a piece of equipment you are carrying, which makes it no longer consume Capacity and now count as being **Equipped**. These verbs are referred to as **Equipping** and **Unequipping** a piece of **Equipment**.

In order to **Equip** an **Augmented** piece of **Equipment**, you must first choose to **Attune** to it. Once you are **Attuned** to an **Augmented** **Equipment**, it can no longer be **Unequipped** by normal means while it remains **Augmented**. Various effects can bypass this restriction however.

### Rolling the equipment
Whenever you acquire a piece of **Equipment**, draw a card from the **Dungeon Deck** and use that to look up the properties of what you found via the [Equipment Table](#equipment-table). The current **Narrator** gets to then describe, based on those properties, what type of **Equipment** you have found. For example if the properties are "Ornate-Arms", then they might describe a gilt inlaid pair of gauntlets.

### Identifying Equipment
There are primarily two common ways to identify an item. The first is using an **Identification Stone**, which is a type of **Consumable item**. The other is by **Equipping** the unidentified item, at which point it will become **Identified** instantly.

If you choose to **Identify** an **Item** by **Equipping** it, and the **Item** turns out to be **Augmented**, *you will instantly **Attune** to it*

When you **Identify** an **Item**, the following steps occur in order:

1. Draw a card from the **Dungeon Deck**
2. If you draw a card that is any suit of {dicier:HEARTS DIAMONDS SPADES}, the item is **Normal**.
3a. However, if you managed to draw a {dicier:CLUBS} suit card, the item is **Augmented**.
3b. If you drew the {dicier:JOKER} card the item is **Augmented** with a guaranteed **Curse**, see the next step.
5. If the equipment is indeed **Augmented**, draw a card from the top of the **Dungeon Deck**. If you got a gauranteed **Curse**, draw cards until you draw a **Face** card.
6. Look up what **Augment** the **Equipment** has on it via the [Augment Table](#augment-table), this piece of **Equipment** now has that **Augmented** on it, and anyone with that piece of **Equipment** **Equipped** has that **Augment** active on them while they keep it equipped on them.
7. Either way, discard any cards drawn.

### Augments

There are a total of 53 **Augments** in the game, one for each card in the Dungeon Deck.
