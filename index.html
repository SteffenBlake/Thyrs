<p>Thyrs is a TTRPG designed to be played with multiple sets of 52 card decks of playing cards. It can be played by any number of players, but its usually best enjoyed with around 2-4.</p>
<p>This game has no concept of a "Game Master", and instead the primary dictation of events derives from cards drown from a core "Dungeon Deck" of cards, which provides the source of random generation of the what the players encounter and contend with. Players take turns molding these random prompts from the deck into describing what everyone encounters and sees.</p>

<h3 id="premise">Premise</h3>
<p>Thyrs is a storytelling game where each player takes on the role of a character that has been trapped deep within the chambers of some form of ancient megastructure, which will further be referred to as the "Dungeon". Players start by discussing what sort of dungeon they are trapped deep within, and what sort of story they want to play in. The dungeon could be an ancient labyrinth, a lich's keep, or perhaps a long abandonded space station. What is important are a few key factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>They are trapped at the deepest part of this dungeon</li>
<li>They want to get out</li>
<li>Everyone starts gathered together in the first chamber</li>
<li>And everyone has a very good reason for how they ended up here</li>
</ol>
<p>The reason for entrapment should be agreed upon next. Perhaps you are all banished prisoners, or maybe you were adventures who took a bad turn and through mishaps ended up falling down deeper than anticipated, or perhaps your life support systems gave out on your ship and you had to make an emergency landing. The options are endless! but what matters is you are here now, and you need to figure out how to survive and escape.</p>
<h3 id="the-thyrs">The Thyrs</h3>
<p>As per the namesake of the game:</p>
<h4 id="thyrs-yrs">Thyrs (þyrs)</h4>
<p>Noun<br />
monster, demon, giant</p>
<p>The Thyrs is the monstrous and supernatural threat that lurks in the dungeon. You see, you are not alone here, and you already can sense it. Something awful lurks through the chambers. Though you haven't encountered it yet, each character already can feel the chill down the backs of their spines as they sense its presence. Players must agree on what the Dungeon's Thyrst is. It can be anything, as long as it fits the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is unimaginably dangerous and certain doom to engage with</li>
<li>You want to avoid it at all costs</li>
<li>This is its home/territory, and you are invaders in it.</li>
<li>It is without a doubt aggressive and will attack anyone in the same chamber as it</li>
</ol>
<p>Its the minotaur of the labyrinth, the Typhon in Tartarus, the Kraken in the sea.</p>
<h3 id="what-you-need-to-play">What you need to play</h3>
<p>To Play Thyrs, you will need the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>A deck of 52 cards for each player</li>
<li>One additional deck of 52 cards + jokers for the "Dungeon Deck".</li>
<li>(Optional) A set of Resource tokens, approximately ~10 or so needed per player.</li>
<li>(Optional) A set of Action Point ("AP") tokens, approximately ~20 or so needed per player. Note you will want Resource and AP tokens to be visually distinct!</li>
<li>(Optional) 1 larger "Stamina" container per player, enough to comfortably hold ~20 AP tokens in it at once</li>
<li>(Optional) 1 smaller "Energy" container per player, enough to comfortably hold ~6 AP tokens in it at once (must be visually identifiable distinct from the Stamina container!)</li>
<li>(Optional) Additional containers for storing Resource tokens for players, and larger containers for storing excess tokens in the center of the table.</li>
<li>(Recommended) Paper and pens/pencils for each player to keep track of their inventory and character's state</li>
</ol>
<p>Recommendation: You will be well served to choose a deck with different visual appearance for each player and the Dungeon Deck, to make it easier to keep track of which cards belong to which/who's decks. Players are encouraged to bring their own decks to the table for personal flair.</p>
